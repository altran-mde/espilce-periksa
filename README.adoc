This is an EMF Validator framework.

TIP: Name Origin: https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/periksa#Indonesian[Indonesian for "to carefully inspect"]

Due to the fragile support of the OCL language and the limited scalability and performance, Altran needs to integrate different solutions for developing EMF Validators.
Such validators are essential for the end-customer to verify that the DSL models created are complete and correct for the intended use.
It is one of the cornerstones of the increased productivity to achieve by applying DSL solutions.
