Espilce Periksa provides a compositional approach to add validations to ecore model instances.
Validations can be easily written by adding a `@Check` annotation to your validation method, as explained in more detail in section <<implementing-validations>>.
The class that implements these `@Check` methods is called a `validator` and needs to be registered to the EMF validation framework as explained in more detail in section <<registering-validators>>.

TIP: Espilce Periksa provides link:{javadoc-location}/index.html[javadoc^] for its reference API.
